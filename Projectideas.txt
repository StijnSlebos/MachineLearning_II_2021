Types of projects

Understanding a new ML paradigm X --- for instance deep learning, some deep reinforcement learning, ... So you study X and apply it to some specific (toy) problems.
Participate in a ML challenge: “To what extend can one automatically classify or predict …. “. For instance see Kaggle. Needed is of course data.
But a mix is also possible. For instance studying the applicability of deep learning to tough classification.

And of course you may define your own project.

    Reinforcement learning deals with learning from delayed feedback through trial and error by an agent acting in an environment. In this way the agent creates its own dataset. OpenAI has created environments and algorithms for you to use, all open source. For more info ask Alex (the TA).
